# ![Django CRUD App - Cat Collector - Django Models](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to understand the role of the Model layer in the Django architecture, define Models to represent database entities, and perform basic CRUD operations using these Models.

## The Model Layer in the Django Architecture

This lesson focuses on the **Model layer** which provides **Views** with access to the **database**

## What’s a Model?

**Models** are used to perform CRUD data operations on a database.

Remember **entities** in the Entity-Relationship-Diagrams?

A Django Model represents a single entity from the ERD.

Thus, a Model has a one-to-one mapping with a table in the database and is what allows us to perform create, read, update and delete data operations on that table.

When we retrieve data from the database (using a Model), we will have **model objects**, each of which represents a row in a database table. Model objects are also called *instances* of the Model. We can work with these instances of the Model just like how we worked with Mongoose documents.

> Note: Since a "model" can technically refer to the Model class or an instance of that class, we will try to use "Model" (capitalized) to refer to a Model class we use to perform CRUD with and "model" (lowercased) to refer to a model instance.

Here's an ERD for the future state of Cat Collector:

## Models in Django

Each Model is defined as a Python class that inherits from `django.db.models.Model`.

Here’s the **Cat** entity from the ERD and the code to define the equivalent Model:

![Cat Model](https://i.imgur.com/gwlOAXc.png)

## Creating a Model

All of the Models for a Django app are defined in the app’s `models.py` file.

Let’s create a `Cat` model in `main_app/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Cat(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    breed = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=250)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```

> When defining fields in a Django model, each field is represented by a specific Field class, such as `CharField` for character strings. You can explore all the available field types in the **[Django documentation on model field types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types)**, which provides a variety of options to suit different data needs.

These field types are important for several reasons:

1. **Validation**: Django uses the field types to apply automatic data validation in forms, ensuring that data conforms to the expected format before it's processed or stored.

2. **Form Rendering**: The field type also determines the default HTML widget used in forms.

For example:

- A `CharField` will typically render as an `<input type="text">` HTML element.
- A `TextField` will render as a `<textarea>`, suitable for longer text inputs.

## Adding a `__str__` method in Models

It’s a best practice to override the `__str__` method in Models so that they will print in a more helpful way.

For the `Cat` model, we’ll code `__str__` to return the cat’s `name` attribute:

```python
class Cat(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    breed = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=250)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    # new code below
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Watch your indentation here! This is a class method so it belongs in the `Cat` class.

## Connecting to the Database

### Installing the PostgreSQL Adapter

Before we can connect to a PostgreSQL database, we need to install the necessary adapter in our Django project's virtual environment. Run the following command in your terminal to install the `psycopg2-binary` package, which allows Django to communicate with PostgreSQL databases:

```bash
pipenv install psycopg2-binary
exit
```

After installation, you can verify that the package has been added by checking your `Pipfile`.

### Creating the `catcollector` Database

In a separate terminal window run the following command:

```bash
createdb catcollector
```

Verify its creation by entering the `psql` shell:

```bash
psql
```

and checking your list of Databases:

```bash
\l
```

Hit enter to exit this view, and run:

```bash
\q
```

to exit the shell.

### Configuring Django to Use PostgreSQL

By default, Django uses SQLite3, which is a minimalist DB suitable for development, but might not be robust enough for production environments.

To switch to PostgreSQL:

1. **Navigate to the `settings.py`** file located in your project directory `catcollector/settings.py`.

2. **Find the `DATABASES` configuration**: This setting defines the details of the database connection. Initially, it's set to use SQLite3, as shown below:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
           'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Modify the configuration for PostgreSQL**: Replace the SQLite settings with PostgreSQL settings. You will specify the `ENGINE` as `django.db.backends.postgresql`, and you'll also need to define the database `NAME` which is the name of your PostgreSQL database.

   After the changes, your setting should look like this:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'catcollector',
       }
   }
   ```

This configuration tells Django to use a PostgreSQL database named `catcollector` for storing all data. Make sure that you have created this database in your PostgreSQL server before running your Django application.

## Making and Running Migrations

### What are Migrations?

**[Migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/migrations/)** are a way to keep the database schema in sync with your Django models. They track changes to your models and apply these changes to your database schema over time, which is essential as the needs of your application evolve.

While migrations are powerful for evolving your database schema, they can be potentially destructive—especially in a production environment—because they can lead to data loss. It's important to handle them with care.

To create migrations, Django provides commands that you can run in your terminal. These commands generate Python files that describe the changes to be made to the database.

### Making Migration Files

Once you've defined a model, like our `Cat` model, the next step is to update the database so it can store data for this model. Before the database knows about our `Cat` model, we need to create migration files.

Run the command below in your terminal to generate migrations for any models that have been added or changed since your last update:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

This command prepares migration files, which Django uses to align the database structure with your current model definitions.

The output in the terminal informs us that the following migration file was created: `main_app/migrations/0001_initial.py`

A `migrations` directory is created for an **app** the first time you run `makemigrations`.

### Examining Migration Files

After creating migration files, you typically don't need to modify them. However, since this is our first migration, it's useful to understand what's inside. Go ahead and open the newly created migration file to see how Django plans to update your database schema.

> 🤯 **Note:** While it's possible to manually edit migration files, it's generally not recommended, especially while you are still learning. Manual edits can lead to unexpected database behaviors and complications.

### Running Migrations

Simply creating migration files does not update the database’s schema.

To synchronize the database with the code in the migration files, we "migrate" using this command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Lots of `OK` messages is what you are looking for!

> 💡 **Rule of Thumb for Migrations:** Whenever you modify a model, always remember to create and apply migrations. This ensures that your database schema is up-to-date with your model definitions.

> 🚨 **Team Collaboration:** In a team setting, designate only one person to create migrations to avoid conflicts. However, every team member should apply these migrations to their local development environment.

## What exactly was created in the database?

To check out the database to see this table being added, we can use our `psql` command in the terminal:

```bash
psql catcollector
```

Then, we can list the tables in the database:

```sql
\dt
```

You should see a table named `main_app_cat` listed!

```plaintext

catcollector=# \dt
                     List of relations
 Schema |            Name            | Type  |    Owner
--------+----------------------------+-------+-------------
 public | auth_group                 | table | user
 public | auth_group_permissions     | table | user
 public | auth_permission            | table | user
 public | auth_user                  | table | user
 public | auth_user_groups           | table | user
 public | auth_user_user_permissions | table | user
 public | django_admin_log           | table | user
 public | django_content_type        | table | user
 public | django_migrations          | table | user
 public | django_session             | table | user
 public | main_app_cat               | table | user    <- Our new table!
(11 rows)

catcollector=#

```

You’ll find quite a few tables with names like `django_*`. These tables are used by the framework to track migrations, server-side sessions, etc.

You’ll also find several tables with names like `auth_*`. These were created by the `django.contrib.auth` app that’s listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` variable within `settings.py`.


## Let's add some cats:

Ultimately we will need some initial data to work with in our application. It is common practice for developers to create what it is called a `seed file` or `seed data` to the database. Below are some cats we can add to our cat model.

If we research our database by entering our psql shell: `psql` or `psql -U postgres`

```sql
\c catcollector;
select * from main_app_cat;
```

This will show us we do not have any cats, yet! - 

---
You are now connected to database "catcollector" as user "devilone".
catcollector=# select * from main_app_cat;
 id | name | breed | description | age 
----+------+-------+-------------+-----
(0 rows)
---

Now let's add some!...

```sql
insert into main_app_cat values
(default, 'Benji', 'calico', 'This kitty kat loves to explore the outdoors.', 2),
(default, 'Felix', 'tabby', 'A curious boy that has used at least six of his nine lives.', 1),
(default, 'Tofu', 'siamese', 'Loves long walks on the beach and trying to catch little fish.', 7),
(default, 'Veronica', 'persian', 'A lazy cat that is aging gracefully. Always looking for a sunny spot to rest.', 10),
(default, 'Dolce', 'ragdoll', 'Fluffy and optimistic. Loves catnip.', 3),
(default, 'Natalya', 'siberian', 'Used to cold environments. On the hunt for prey.', 8),
(default, 'Heathcliff', 'sphinx', 'Fat cat with an endless appetite.', 9),
(default, 'Bill', 'maine coon', 'Tuna, tuna tuna!', 4),
(default, 'Dev', 'devon rex', 'Always jumping and playful. Feed him a treat!', 4),
(default, 'Mary', 'oriental', 'Beautiful coat of fluffy fur. Loves to cuddle.', 2),
(default, 'Hussein', 'ragdoll', 'Will sleep on your head and meow up a storm when it is time to wake up.', 3),
(default, 'Shelly', 'calico', 'Pretty girl that loves watching her big brother bird named, Tweety!', 3);
```
