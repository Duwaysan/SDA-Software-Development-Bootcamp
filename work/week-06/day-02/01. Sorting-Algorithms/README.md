## Morning Activity

This morning we will give you some time to start learning about computer science! In your `resources` folder there is a `Computer-Science` folder that has several comp-sci related topics. This morning we will discuss the computer science modules: `07. Distribution Sorting Algorithms`, `08. Divide-And-Conquer-Sorting`, and do a live demonstration to get an idea of what is going on!
