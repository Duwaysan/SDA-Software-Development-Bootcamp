# ![Django CRUD App - Cat Collector - Setup](./assets/hero.png)

## Setup

1. Navigate to your SDA-Ghazal Course Folder

2. CD into `./applications/cat-collector-mpa` (create folder if you have not!)

3. Create a python virtual environment and we will install Django with: `pipenv shell`

4. This command will create a new `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` in your project directory, specifying Django as a dependency.

5. Activate the virtual environment: `pipenv install django`

> With your virtual environment activated you should see a slight change in your terminal, with the virtual environment folder name listed to the left of your command line prompt.

6. Start a new Django project within your virtual environment:  `django-admin startproject catcollector-mpa .`

7. Open the current folder in VSCode: `code .`

8. **When you are done you can deactivate the virtual environment: `exit`.**

**HINT => you will keep the virtual environment running for as long as you are working. If you are done working for the day and want to close the vscode / project.. disconnect your server and your virtual environments first!**
