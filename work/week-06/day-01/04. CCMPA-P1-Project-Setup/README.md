## About

Welcome to Cat_Collector, your first venture into building a full CRUD application using Django! This project is an excellent example of what you'll be capable of creating for future full-stack Django projects. Cat_Collector is a playful application where you can manage a database of adorable cats and their toys. Throughout this project, you will learn how to implement full CRUD operations in a PostgreSQL Database as well as establish User Authentication and Authorization— foundational skills for any full stack engineer. This hands-on project will not only solidify your understanding of Django's powerful built in capabilities, but also prepare you for creating your own robust full-stack web applications. Get ready to build a GA classic, long live Cat_Collector!


## Process

We will walk through each of the steps in this folder together so you can learn how to scaffold (build) a basic Django Application starting point. Once we complete these steps as a class, you will repeat them on your own to complete the `Finch Collector` lab that is explained in the `05. Finch-Collector-MPA-Part1` folder in today's folder.
