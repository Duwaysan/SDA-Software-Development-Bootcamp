# ![Django CRUD App - Cat Collector - Django One-to-Many Relationships](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to implement and manage one-to-many relationships in Django by adding a Feeding model related to the Cat model.

# A cat’s got to eat!

In this lesson, we'll explore how to add another model in Django to demonstrate working with **one-to-many** relationships.

We'll use an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to illustrate this relationship:

![ERD](./assets/one-to-many-erd.png)

In this relationship, each cat will have many feedings, and each feeding will belong to a specific cat.

## Adding a new `Feeding` Model

Using the ERD above as a guide, let’s add a new `Feeding` Model (below the current `Cat` Model) in our `models.py`:

```python
# Add new Feeding model below Cat model

class Feeding(models.Model):
    date = models.DateField()
    meal = models.CharField(max_length=1)
```

> Note that we’re going to use just a single-character to represent what meal the feeding is for: ***B***reakfast, ***L***unch or ***D***inner.

## Field.choices

Django has a feature, **[Field.choices](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/models/fields/#choices)**, that will make the single-characters more user-friendly by automatically generating a select dropdown in the form using descriptions that we define.

The first step is to define a tuple of 2-tuples. Because we might need to access this tuple within the `Cat` class also, let’s define it above both of the Model classes:

```python
# A tuple of 2-tuples added above our models
MEALS = (
    ('B', 'Breakfast'),
    ('L', 'Lunch'),
    ('D', 'Dinner')
)


class Cat(models.Model):
```

As you can see, the first item in each 2-tuple represents the value that will be stored in the database, e.g. `B`.

The second item represents the human-friendly "display" value, e.g., `Breakfast`.

Now let’s enhance the `meal` field as follows:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
    date = models.DateField()
    meal = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        # add the 'choices' field option
        choices=MEALS,
        # set the default value for meal to be 'B'
        default=MEALS[0][0]
    )
```

## Override the `__str__` Method

As is common in python classes, we can override the `__str__` method in Models so that they provide more meaningful output when they are printed:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
    # Other Feeding class fields here

    def __str__(self):
        # Nice method for obtaining the friendly value of a Field.choice
        return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"
```

Check out the convenient `get_meal_display()` method Django *automagically* creates to access the human-friendly value of a `Field.choice` like we have on `meal`.

## Add the Foreign Key

Since a `Feeding` **belongs to** a `Cat`, it must hold the `id` of the cat object it belongs to - it needs a **foreign key**!

Here’s how it’s done - Django style:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
    date = models.DateField()
    meal = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        choices=MEALS,
        default=MEALS[0][0]
    )
    # Create a cat_id column for each feeding in the database
    cat = models.ForeignKey(Cat, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"
```

As you can see, the `ForeignKey` field-type is used to create a one-to-many relationship.

- The first argument provides the parent Model, `Cat`.
- In a one-to-many relationship, the `on_delete=models.CASCADE` is required. It ensures that if a `Cat` record is deleted, all of the child `Feedings` will be deleted automatically as well - thus avoiding *orphan* records for feedings that are no longer tied to an existing Cat.

> 🧠 In the database, the column in the feedings table for the FK will actually be called `cat_id` because Django by default appends `_id` to the name of the attribute used in the Model.

## Make and Run the Migration

We changed our `models.py` file, so it’s that time again! Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Use the Admin Portal to create some new feedings

Before we start building the user interface (UI) for our new feedings model, let's practice adding a few feedings using the Django admin portal. This will give us some data to display and allow us to create our feedings' index UI first.

### Registering the Model

To use the built-in Django admin portal for CRUD operations, we must first register the model. Update `main_app/admin.py` to include the `Feeding` model:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
# Add Feeding to the import
from .models import Cat, Feeding

admin.site.register(Cat)
# Register the new Feeding model
admin.site.register(Feeding)
```

Now, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and click on the **Feeding +Add** link.

![Django Admin UI Add Feeding](./assets/django-admin-add.png)

Notice the select drop-downs for assigning both the Meal and the Cat!

## Custom field labels

Let’s say though, that you would like a less vague label than **Date**.

If you want to use a more descriptive label than **Date**, you can customize field labels directly in the model. Since ***Django models are the single source of truth about your data***, this is where you should add customizations.

In `main_app/models.py`, update the `Feeding` model to include a user-friendly label for the `date` field:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
    # The first optional positional argument overrides the label
    date = models.DateField('Feeding date')
    # Other fields below
```

After making this change, refresh the admin portal page to see the updated label.

![Feeding Label Update](./assets/update-date-label.png)

These custom labels will also be used in all of Django’s `ModelForms`.

### Add a few feedings

Now, go ahead and add a few feedings for each of your cats using the admin portal. This will populate your database with initial data, which will be useful for building and testing your UI.

## Displaying a Cat’s Feedings

The cat's detail page is the perfect place to display a cat's feedings because it provides a comprehensive view of all the important information about that specific cat in one place. This is similar to how you would see a list of all tasks on a project detail page. By showing feedings on the cat's detail page, users can easily see the feeding history along with other details about the cat, making the information more accessible and organized.

No additional views or templates are necessary. We only need to update the `detail.html` template.

### Update the `detail.html` template

Here's the new content for `detail.html`. Copy and paste this markup, and then we'll review it:

```html
<!-- Existing cat-container above -->
<div class="feedings-toy-container">
  <section class="feedings">
    <div class="subsection-title">
      <h2>Feedings</h2>
      <img
        src="{% static 'images/cat-cone.svg' %}"
        alt="An ice cream cone cat"
      />
      <img src="{% static 'images/cat-onigiri.svg' %}" alt="A cat as onigiri" />
      <img
        src="{% static 'images/kitty-kabob.svg' %}"
        alt="A kabob of kittens"
      />
    </div>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Date</th>
          <th>Meal</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {% for feeding in cat.feeding_set.all %}
          <tr>
            <td>{{feeding.date}}</td>
            <td>{{feeding.get_meal_display}}</td>
          </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>
</div>

{% endblock %}
```

- In this code we have added an html table to present the feeding data in an more structured way.
- The table body (`<tbody>`) dynamically lists each feeding associated with the cat. This is done through a loop (`{% for feeding in cat.feeding_set.all %}`) that iterates over each feeding related to the cat.
- For each feeding, the date is displayed, and the meal type is shown using Django's `get_meal_display` method, which translates a database value into a more user-friendly format (such as converting a single character like 'B' into "Breakfast").

Refresh your browser and select a cat to see their feedings!

## Adding new feedings from the Detail page

As developers, we can add feedings easily from the admin portal, but this helpful dashboard is not available to users of our application.

Next, we will add functionality for users to add feedings directly from a cat's detail page. This requires integrating a form on the page that can handle the creation of new feedings linked to that specific cat.

In previous sections, we've utilized Django's class-based views to manage create and update operations. These CBVs automatically handle form generation and data submission by using a `ModelForm` tied to a specific model behind the scenes.

For adding feedings through the cat's detail page, we'll need to add a custom `ModelForm`. This form will allow us to embed feeding-related inputs within a custom `<form>` tag, manage form validation, and save new feeding entries to the database.

## Create the `ModelForm` for the `Feeding` Model

We could define the `ModelForm` inside of the `models.py` module, but we’re going to follow a best practice of defining it inside of a `forms.py` module instead. Run the following in the terminal:

```bash
touch main_app/forms.py
```

Let’s open it and add this code:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Feeding

class FeedingForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Feeding
        fields = ['date', 'meal']
```

Note that our custom form inherits from `ModelForm`.

> Many of the attributes in the `Meta` class are in common with CBVs because the CBV was using them behind the scenes to create a ModelForm as previously mentioned.

For more options, check out the **[Django ModelForms documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelform)**.

## Passing an instance of `FeedingForm`

`FeedingForm` is a class that needs to be instantiated in the `cat_detail` view function so that it can be rendered inside of `detail.html`.

Here’s the updated `cat_detail` view function in `main_app/views.py`:

```python
from .models import Cat
# Import the FeedingForm
from .forms import FeedingForm

# Other view functions above

# update this view function
def cat_detail(request, cat_id):
    cat = Cat.objects.get(id=cat_id)
    # instantiate FeedingForm to be rendered in the template
    feeding_form = FeedingForm()
    return render(request, 'cats/detail.html', {
        # include the cat and feeding_form in the context
        'cat': cat, 'feeding_form': feeding_form
    })
```

`feeding_form` is set to an instance of `FeedingForm` and then it’s passed to `detail.html` just like `cat`.

## Displaying `FeedingForm` inside of **`detail.html`**

Okay, so we’re going to need a form used to submit a new feeding.

We’re going to display a `<form>` at the top of the feedings column in **`detail.html`**.

This is how we can "render" the `ModelForm`’s inputs within `<form>` tags. Add this section in `templates/cats/detail.html` just above the `<table>` for displaying feedings:

```html
<h3>Add a Feeding</h3>
<!-- Add just above the feedings table -->
<form action="" method="post" class="subsection-content" autocomplete="off">
  {% csrf_token %} 
  {{ feeding_form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit" class="btn submit">Add Feeding</button>
</form>
```

As before, we need to include the `{% csrf_token %}` for security purposes.

A form’s `action` attribute determines the URL that a form is submitted to. For now, we’ll leave it out and come back to it in a bit.

The `{{ feeding_form.as_p }}` will generate the `<input>` tags wrapped in `<p>` tags for each field we specified in `FeedingForm`.

Let’s see what it looks like - not perfect but it’s a start:

![Feeding Form](./assets/feeding-form.png)

Unfortunately, you may have noticed that the *Feeding Date* field is just a basic text input. This is what Django uses by default for `DateField`s. Let's make it a date picker instead.

## Use Django's `DateInput`

To improve user experience and maintain consistent date formatting, we'll be adding a "date picker"—a user interface component that lets users easily select dates. This feature is supported by HTML5 and is common in web forms. Django supports this with a built in `DateInput` widget, which is built on top of the standard HTML date picker to integrate smoothly with Django's `DateField`.

For our `Feeding` model's form, we specify Django's built-in date picker as a widget for the date field. This creates a visually pleasing date selection process on the frontend and ensures that date data remains consistent on the backend.

> In Django forms, the `widgets` attribute is used to customize how form fields are rendered in the HTML and to add specific HTML attributes to those fields.

Update the `FeedingForm` in `forms.py` to include a new property called `widgets`:

```python
class FeedingForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Feeding
        fields = ['date', 'meal']
        widgets = {
            'date': forms.DateInput(
                format=('%Y-%m-%d'),
                attrs={
                    'placeholder': 'Select a date',
                    'type': 'date'
                }
            ),
        }
```

By specifying these attributes and using a `DateInput` widget, the date field in the form will render as an HTML date input. This allows users to select a date using a mini calendar-style date picker, which is much more user-friendly.

Refresh the page to see your DateInput widget in action:

![Date input widget](./assets/date-widget.png)

## Create new `path` for feedings

Its time to complete our form functionality by enabling the route we'll use as the form action for new `Feedings`.

Every `Feeding` object needs a `cat_id` that holds the primary key of the cat object that it belongs to. Therefore, we need to ensure that the route `path` includes a *URL parameter* for capturing the cat’s `id` like we’ve done in other routes.

Add a route to the `urlpatterns` list in **`urls.py`** like this:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    # Existing URL patterns above
    path(
        'cats/<int:cat_id>/add-feeding/', 
        views.add_feeding, 
        name='add-feeding'
    ),
]
```

The above route specifies that the `<form>`’s **action** attribute will need to look something like `/cats/2/add-feeding`. Let's update the form now.

## Add the `action` Attribute to the `<form>`

Now that we have a *named URL*, let’s add the `action` attribute to the `<form>` in `detail.html`:

```html
<h3>Add a Feeding</h3>
<form
  action="{% url 'add-feeding' cat.id %}"
  method="post"
  class="subsection-content"
  autocomplete="off"
>
  {% csrf_token %} 
  {{ feeding_form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit" class="btn submit">Add Feeding</button>
</form>
```

> Note that arguments provided to template tags are always separated using a space, not a comma.

Once again, we’re using best practice of using the `url` template tag `{% url 'add-feeding' cat.id %}` to write out the correct the URL for a route.

Our form is now complete, but before we can test, we need to add the `views.add_feeding` function.

## Add the View function

This view is designed to handle the submission of a feeding form associated with a specific cat.

This form will capture the feeding data entered by the user, but will be missing one key piece of information that we will need to add manually before sending the data to the database- `cat_id`.

Let’s create an `add_feeding` view function in `main_app/views.py` :

```python
def add_feeding(request, cat_id):
    # create a ModelForm instance using the data in request.POST
    form = FeedingForm(request.POST)
    # validate the form
    if form.is_valid():
        # don't save the form to the db until it
        # has the cat_id assigned
        new_feeding = form.save(commit=False)
        new_feeding.cat_id = cat_id
        new_feeding.save()
    return redirect('cat-detail', cat_id=cat_id)
```

1. First we capture data from the user via the `FeedingForm(request.POST)` and prepare it for the database.
2. The method `form.is_valid()` checks if the submitted form data is valid according to the form's specifications, such as required fields being filled and data types matching the model's requirements.
3. After ensuring that the form contains valid data, we save the form with the `commit=False` option, which returns an in-memory model object so that we can assign the `cat_id` before actually saving to the database.
4. Finally we will `redirect` instead of `render` since data has been changed in the database.

Lastly, remember to import `redirect` at the top of `views.py`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
```

With our view complete we can test our form.

Nice Job!

## Adjust the order of feedings

Now we have the ability to add feedings, great! But as our list of feedings grows we'll need to scroll to the bottom to see the latest information. This is not a great user experience. How can we fix this?

We can use a feature in Django that sorts the feedings automatically. This is done by setting an `ordering` option inside the `Feeding` model's `class Meta`.

Let's add this to our `Feeding` model:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
    # Other Feeding model items above

    def __str__(self):
        # Nice method for obtaining the friendly value of a Field.choice
        return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"

    # Define the default order of feedings
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-date']  # This line makes the newest feedings appear first
```

This `ordering` option in Django allows us to specify how lists of entries, like our feedings, should be sorted by default. The prefix '-' before 'date' means it sorts the dates in descending order, so the newest feedings appear first.

### What if there are no feedings yet?

We can also add some conditional logic in our markup that tells the user whether or not a cat has been fed.

Replace the existing feedings table with the following:

```html
<h3>Past Feedings</h3>
{% if cat.feeding_set.all.count %}
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Meal</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for feeding in cat.feeding_set.all %}
      <tr>
        <td>{{feeding.date}}</td>
        <td>{{feeding.get_meal_display}}</td>
      </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
  </table>
{% else %}
  <div class="subsection-content">
    <p>⚠️ {{cat.name}} has not been fed!</p>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

Now if a cat has a feeding count of `0` in the database, you'll see a warning message.

Feed your cats!
