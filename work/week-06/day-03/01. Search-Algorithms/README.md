## Morning Activity

This morning we will give you some time to start learning about computer science! In your `resources` folder there is a `Computer-Science` folder that has several comp-sci related topics. This morning you should read through the material in: `09. Search Algorithms`. We will have a quick discussion about the core concepts after you briefly walk through.
