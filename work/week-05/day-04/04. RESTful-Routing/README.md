# RESTful Routing
RESTful routing stands for **Representational State Transfer** and uses our resources (entities in our database) as the focal point of how to organize our code. If you haven't heard this phrase yet, "Data is the single source of truth", is a popular phrase within the software / tech community. It means that we use our hard coded data to make and inform decisions throughout our applications. 


The entire point of restful routing is to give engineers a structure with which to __route__ incoming http requests from the client to endpoints in the server to specific code to execute that code. The concepts are based around CRUD and Resources having crud performed on them in the database...

- (C) Create, 
- (R) Read,
- (U) Update,
- (D) Delete,

Today we will take the following ERD diagram and generate the restful routing chart / table!
