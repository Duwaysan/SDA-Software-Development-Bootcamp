## Python Banking Walkthrough

We will walkthrough building a python banking app together to get a better feel for the process / concepts and possible approaches to developing more effective code.

Keep in mind that 'development' is a process! More specifically software development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software applications that solve problems, automate tasks, or provide value to users. It combines programming, problem-solving, and engineering principles to build reliable and efficient software.

Key aspects of software development:

**Problem-solving:** Understanding user needs and translating them into functional software.

**Programming:** Writing code in languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, or C#.

**Design & Architecture:** Structuring software for maintainability, scalability, and performance.

**Collaboration:** Often involves teams working together using version control (e.g., Git) and project management tools.

**Refactoring:** Updating code over time to make space for changes due to enhancements or additions.
