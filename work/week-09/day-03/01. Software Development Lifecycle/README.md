# QUESTIONS

How do you turn an idea for an application into a real, working product — in a way that's predictable, organized, and reduces the chance of failure?  
This is a question every engineering team must answer, and the industry’s response is the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**

---

## What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for building high-quality software efficiently.  
It breaks down software development into **clear, repeatable phases**, helping teams reduce risks, avoid wasting time, and deliver better products.

SDLC helps answer critical questions **before** coding starts:  
- What are we building?
- Why are we building it?
- How will it work?
- How will we know it's done correctly?

> Scenario: Imagine trying to build a skyscraper without blueprints. It would be chaotic, dangerous, and expensive.  
> SDLC is the set of blueprints for building software — carefully, thoughtfully, step-by-step.

## Quick History of SDLC

The first structured approaches to software development appeared in the **1960s**, when engineers realized that as systems grew more complex, building software needed to be treated more like **engineering** than **art**.

- Early models were heavily influenced by manufacturing and construction (e.g., **Waterfall**).
- Over time, models like **Agile** and **Iterative development** emerged to offer more flexibility.
- Today, SDLC is not a single strict method — it is a **general philosophy** for organizing complex software projects in manageable ways.

## Common SDLC Models

| Model | Description | When It's Used |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Waterfall** | Complete each phase fully before moving on. | Best when requirements are clear and unlikely to change. |
| **Agile** | Work in small, iterative cycles (sprints). | Best when requirements are evolving or unclear. |
| **Iterative** | Build a basic version first, improve it over time. | Good when you expect to learn and adapt as you go. |
| **Spiral** | Focus heavily on risk analysis and incremental improvement. | Best for large, high-risk systems like defense or medical projects. |
| **V-Model** | Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase. | Best when extreme quality control is needed, like in aerospace. |

> Scenario: If you're building a Mars Rover's navigation system, you might use **V-Model**.  
> If you're building a new food delivery app, **Agile** would be a better fit.

## The Phases of the SDLC

Each phase flows naturally into the next — like chapters of a story, not isolated events.

**1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis**
- Understand what problem needs solving.
- Interview stakeholders, analyze user needs, and document expectations.

> Example: For a new ride-sharing app, you would interview drivers, riders, and regulators to understand must-have features like ride requests, payments, driver ratings, and safety requirements.

**2. System Design**
- Translate requirements into a technical blueprint.
- Create system architecture diagrams, database schemas, wireframes.

> Example: Sketch out how users will sign up, request rides, and pay drivers through the app.

**3. Implementation (Coding)**
- Developers write actual code based on the designs.
- Best practices include source control (Git), coding standards, and code reviews.

> Example: Backend engineers build the trip management API, frontend developers build the ride request screens.

**4. Testing**
- Thoroughly check if the system works as intended.
- Types of testing: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).

> Example: Simulate a user booking a ride, a driver accepting it, and a payment being processed — checking for errors at every step.

**5. Deployment**
- Launch the product into a live environment for real users.
- May include gradual rollout (beta release) or full release.

> Example: Release the app first in a single city to gather early feedback before expanding nationwide.

**6. Maintenance**
- Ongoing support after launch.
- Fix bugs, improve performance, adapt to user feedback or changes in technology.

> Example: Releasing a new feature to allow ride-sharing for multiple passengers.

## Why SDLC Matters

- **Clarity**: Everyone knows what is happening and when.
- **Quality**: Problems are detected early when they are cheaper to fix.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces wasted effort and rework.
- **Predictability**: Improves ability to meet deadlines and budgets.
- **Learning**: Encourages documenting what worked (and didn’t) for future improvement.

> Key Lesson: **Process doesn’t slow you down. Bad process slows you down. Good process makes success repeatable.**

## Quick Recap

- SDLC is a structured framework for delivering software successfully.
- Different projects may use different SDLC models based on needs.
- The core phases are: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
- Good SDLC practices make software more reliable, more efficient, and more user-friendly.

# SDLC Activity: Plan Your Own Software Project

Welcome to your first SDLC planning simulation!  
Your team will **create a lightweight SDLC plan** for a brand-new project.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Form Your Team
- Work in groups of 3–5 people.

### 2. Choose Your Project Idea
Pick one simple app idea to build:
- A **budget tracking app**
- A **habit tracker app**
- A **basic blogging platform**

---

## SDLC Planning Steps

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Write down 3–5 must-have features your app will support.
   
   Example:
   > \"Users must be able to add expenses, set budget goals, and view reports.\"

2. **System Design**
   - Sketch a basic system or user flow diagram.
   
   Example:
   > Draw a simple map showing Login → Dashboard → Add Expense → Reports.

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Break the work into 5–7 major coding tasks.

   Example:
   > \"Set up user authentication,\" \"Create expense entry form,\" \"Generate monthly reports.\"

4. **Testing Plan**
   - Write down what you would test before launch.

   Example:
   > \"Test if users can sign up, log in, and add expenses without errors.\"

5. **Deployment Plan**
   - Describe where/how you'd launch your app.

   Example:
   > \"Launch a beta version online, using Heroku or Vercel.\"

6. **Maintenance Plan**
   - What future updates might you need?

   Example:
   > \"Add push notifications to remind users about goals.\"

---

## Deliverable

Each team will present a simple 2-minute overview of:
- Their project idea
- One key risk they foresee in their SDLC plan (and how they might manage it)

---

## Reflection (Optional if Time Allows)

Answer these quick questions as a team:
- Which phase felt easiest to plan?
- Which phase felt most uncertain?
- How might your plan change if customer needs shifted halfway through?

---

## Key Reminders

- Focus on clarity, not technical detail.
- Think about real-world risks (budget, deadlines, user feedback).
- Be creative but realistic — treat this like a \"starter\" project plan.

---

## Goal of this Activity

- Practice visualizing a complete software lifecycle.
- Understand how SDLC phases connect in real projects.
- Get hands-on experience thinking through software design beyond just writing code.
