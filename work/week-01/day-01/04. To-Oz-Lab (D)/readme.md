## Instructions

2. When it asks you to create a file (**not directories**), make them `.txt` file-types! 

## Setup

1. Create a new directory `House` in the current `04. To-Oz-Lab (D)` directory.
2. Add files: `Dorothy.txt` and `Toto.txt` in the `./House` directory.
3. Create a new directory `Oz` in the current `04. To-Oz-Lab (D)` directory.
4. Add files for the 4 Witches to `Oz`...

### Follow the Yellow Brick Road

> In the directory `Oz`...
