# HTML and CSS - Carbon Copy

Does anybody know what a "carbon copy" is?

## 📖 Definition: Carbon Copy

General definition: A carbon copy is an exact duplicate of something.

Origin: The term comes from the days of typewriters, when people placed carbon paper between sheets to make a perfect copy of whatever was typed.

Modern use: We often say “make a carbon copy” when we mean “make something that looks exactly the same as the original.”

## 🎯 Pixel Perfect

The idea behind asking for a carbon copy of something or to make a pizel perfect design is to say that I am working towards turning a wireframe or a persons drawn out design into an actual web design with HTML and CSS that looks exactly like the design the person created. 

One of our jobs as a frontend engineer is to do exactly that. We need to be able to take conceptual designs and turn them into reality.

Today, we will do exactly that as a class and then you will do your own version with the 'Wendy Bite' lab in the afternoon.

So, here's the wireframe:
