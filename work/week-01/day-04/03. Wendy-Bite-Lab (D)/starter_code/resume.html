        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>I recently graduated from a Web Development course at General Assembly where I increased my typing speed from
            10 words per minute on my type writer to 100 words per minute on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught me how
            to be an <strong>awesome</strong>Web Developer. During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics,
            pickling, and spending time with my great grand children.</p>
        <p>Thank You for being a friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart is true, you"re a pal and a
            confidante.And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from
            me and the card attached would say, Thank You For Being a Friend!</p>
