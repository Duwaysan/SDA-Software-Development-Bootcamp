## What is Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual layout of a webpage or app before adding detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

## Think of it as a blueprint for digital design:

- It shows structure (what sections exist, like header, nav, content, footer).

- It shows placement (where things go on the page).

- It does not focus on styling — wireframes are often black-and-white boxes, lines, and labels.

## Key purposes of wireframing:

Helps designers, developers, and stakeholders agree on layout before building.

Provides a clear plan for how content and navigation will be organized.

Saves time by preventing major redesigns later.

Example:

A wireframe for a blog might show:

A header box at the top (for the logo/title).

A sidebar box on the left (for navigation).

Large rectangle in the middle (for blog posts).

Footer box at the bottom (for contact info).

📌 In short: Wireframing is sketching the skeleton of a webpage.
