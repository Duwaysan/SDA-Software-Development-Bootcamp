# Let's Build a Portfolio

It is extremely common, as junior software engineers, to use portfolios as a means of expressing to others how far you have come as an engineer and where your strengths and interests are.

Today we will again use our experiences with HTML and CSS to build a starting point for a portfolio that you can use by the end of this course. Th

## Instructions 
1. **Copy** the `/portfolio` directory in the same folder as this `readme.md` file. It includes `index.html` and `/css/styles.css` file. 
2. **Paste** into `~/code` folder.
3. Build your portfolio!
4. Example of proper structure (already done):
   
```
/portfolio
	/css
        /style.css
    /index.html
```

## Requirements
You must have **at a minimum** each of the following items:
1. one html file
2. one css file
3. one link (anchor tag: <a>link here</a>)
4. one image
5. one emoji
6. fun information about yourself : )
7. your name!

## Tips && Hints

* Think about who you want to view your site (potential employers, freelance opportunities, friends). I know it is tempting to make it flashy, but the most important thing when designing your site is to make it EASY for your visitors to access the information they want and navigate around the page.

* Think about the goal for your site and what you want your users to do (read about your story, look at your work/code/writing, contact you). Guide them to taking those actions by making them prominent / easy to find.

* **Wireframe** what you want your site to look like first!

* **Use proper indentation and organize your code**. Chances are people will view your source!
