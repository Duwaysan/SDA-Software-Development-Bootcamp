# EXERCISE

We now need to practice making our own requests and respond to those requests by running code. Let's attempt the following user stories:

1. As a User I want to see a list of all dog breeds when I arrive at the dog page.
2. As a User I want to be able to see a photo of the dog breed I select.
3. As a User I want to be able to see a random dog photo if I click on the random button.

## SCRIPT.JS

Implement each of the above user stories / feature requests above using the `script.js` file. You will need to research the `https://dog.ceo/` website to find information about their API and figure out which endpoints to use to accomplish this. Upon completion of researching the API ensure you have your html and css prepped / ready to go so you can implement the fetch requests needed to make these features a reality.
