## Morning Activity

This morning we will give you some time to start learning about computer science! In your `resources` folder there is a `Computer-Science` folder that has several comp-sci related topics. Today just start with the `01. Intro-To-Comp-Sci`

<br/><br/>

**Take a walk through the resource page and get a feel for what computer science is. We will continue to work these ideas into our lessons and conversations throughout the course!**

<br/><br/>

**Feel free to add notes in the notes.txt file in this current folder.**
