# Tic-Tac-Toe-Live

This will be a live walkthrough on how to build Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser. I will not use any notes unless I look them up with you as a class, to show you the approach I will take and why I make the decisions I make. We will build it together and you will receive a copy of the code at the end. 

<br/><br/>

## Setup

We will first need to generate our folder structure for holding our browser based game. Please generate this structure in the current `./03 TIC-TAC-TOE-LIVE` folder. It should look like this.

<br/><br/>

The structure below is the standard setup for deploying and developing a webpage with HTML, CSS, and JS.

```
/02. TIC-TAC-TOE-LIVE
	/game
		/css
            /style.css
	    /index.html
        /js
            /app.js
```
