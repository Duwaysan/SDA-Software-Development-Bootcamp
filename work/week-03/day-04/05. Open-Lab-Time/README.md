## Open Lab Time

Use this time to catch up on any work / homework you have not been able to complete yet and to ask questions you may have about course materials. If you are up-to-date with work and do not have any questions -> use this time to go through level-up / bonus content.. code challenges, etc. Maybe try building a browser based game and deploying it? Or ask one of your instructors for some extra content / a challenge.
