## Python CSV

In order to complete your first project we will need to talk you through using Python's built in CSV package. The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#). For the most part, the example csv file in this same folder should provide a solid foundation for using the CSV import. If you're confused, go check out the documentation!
