## Morning Activity


### Python Code Challenges
This morning we will assign the Python Code Challenges that will be graded for the next two weeks and introduce two websites that offer code challenges outside of the included course work.

Once again, code challenges and going through the process of writing the algorithms to solve the challenges, are extremely important in learning how to solve problems within web development as a whole. It is the process that matters as that is what we do on a daily basis. We solve problems using a set of logical steps to accomplish our goals.

### Hacker Rank and Leet Code

[Hacker Rank](http://hackerrank.com) and [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com) are two of the most commonly used websites to challenge new developers to grow their programming skills. Code challenges test several different skills within the programming world. These skills include (but are not limited to): Algorithmic Thinking & Data Structures, Problem-Solving & Analytical Thinking, Coding Fluency & Debugging, System Design & Scalability (For senior roles), Language & Framework-Specific Knowledge. These two sites are of the most popular to use for helping you to test and grow those skills. 

- Take a look at the above sites, make an account, explore, and either continue doing code challenges on one of those two sites or continue with the code challenges in the resources folder. :grinning:
