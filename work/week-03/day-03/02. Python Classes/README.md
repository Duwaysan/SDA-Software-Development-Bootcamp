## About

In this module, we'll focus on the essential concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python through classes. Classes are a fundamental part of Python that let you bundle data and functions together in a single entity. That single entity can then be used to make any number of objects that co This makes your code more organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.

We'll cover how to create classes, make objects from them, and use inheritance and encapsulation to structure your code effectively. By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to build your own classes and use them to represent real-world situations in a more practical way.
