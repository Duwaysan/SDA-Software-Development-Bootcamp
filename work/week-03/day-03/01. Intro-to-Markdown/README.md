## Morning Activity

This morning we will do a quick walk-through to show you how to use markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is the language that you can use to write readme's and allows you quick access to some basic formatting and style. You will use this to create your readmes for each of your projects and down the road will most likely use it for documentation.

**We will take a quick walk through the markdown resource page (in your resource folder) and get a feel for what MARKDOWN is, then do a quick, live, demonstration!**
