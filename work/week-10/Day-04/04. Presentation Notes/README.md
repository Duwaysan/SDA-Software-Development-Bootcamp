# Capstone Project Presentation

Congratulations! This is it.. every moment in the last nine weeks has lead up to this point. We hope you learned a lot and ready to present your amazing projects. Below is a guide to use for your presentations. Use it wisely!

## When and Where

In the presentation room upstairs at starting at 10:00am **SHARP!** **(on time!!!!)**

## Format

You will connect your own laptops to the classroom's large portable monitor at the front of the room.

## Timing

You have 10 minutes for the entire process. This can include about 8 minutes of presentation time and around 2 minutes of applause or discussion. We won't be looking at a watch - don't stress about _specific_ timing.

## Notes
If you need to write down notes / a guide, that is ok, but if you use your work to do the talking, it will be natural! You can certainly write down words you struggle with. Be confident!
