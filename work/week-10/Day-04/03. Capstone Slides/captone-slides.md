# Capstone Powerpoint

In your journey as a software developer you will need to interact with people from every part of the business that you work in, from Users to the CEO. Having the ability to present ideas in quick and clear format can be key to your success. Keeping this in mind, SDA would like each student to produce a power point presentation of your project.

- This slide deck has the potential to be used in many ways by yourselves and by SDA to present your project ideas to others, including potential employers. 

- We are providing a slide deck template that you can use if you like (link below.)

- Otherwise, you are welcome to build your own. You can use these slide decks to present the project idea before showing your application functionality.

The template is here: [SLIDE DECK TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sc7nuPc80caqj0CZFCnEgjzJQ601UAkUfuZtSaVOaBE/edit?usp=sharing)
