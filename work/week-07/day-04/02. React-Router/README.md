## About

This module introduces the essentials of React Router, a powerful library used for adding navigation functionality within React applications. You'll learn how to install React Router, use link components for navigation, handle client-side routing, and implement dynamic routes.

Additionally, the lessons will cover programmatic navigation to manage redirects, making the user experience in your single-page applications more like multi-page applications. Each topic is designed to build on your existing knowledge of React components, controlled forms, and passing props.
