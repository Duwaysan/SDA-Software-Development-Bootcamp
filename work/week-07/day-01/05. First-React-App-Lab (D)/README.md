# REACT LABS
Each react lab will build on the previous lab by adding to the same application that you will build in your `SDA-Ghazal/applications/react_labs`. We will do this for two reasons...

- React applications can take up quite a bit of space on your computers and take time to build from the ground up.

- You are more likely to build on one idea than you are to continuously create new applications over and over again. best to get the experience of continuing to build on one idea and seeing how code can be organized to help make projects easier to build and expand upon.

## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

Reactville Weather Station is at the heart of the town, keeping everyone informed about the ever-changing weather. They're in need of a tech upgrade and have called on you to develop their new 5-Day Weather Forecast App. 

## First React Lab

This particular lab is just a starting point for a new application. Just like we did in class today, you will create a new react app, but this time it will be in your applications folder. 

## Setup

**IN YOUR APPLICATIONS FOLDER!!!**

1. `npm create vite@latest first-react-app-lab`
2. `Select a framework:` => `React`
3. `Select a variant` => `Javascript`
4. `Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?:` => `No`
5. `Install with npm and start now?:` => `Yes`
6. Navigate to `localhost:5173` (check app is running)
7. `ctrl+c` => terminate running application
8. `cd project-name`
9. `npm i -D @types/react @types/react-dom` (helps with intellisense / autocomplete!)
10. `npm run dev` when ready to spin up your app!
