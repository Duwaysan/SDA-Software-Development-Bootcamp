# Full Stack Capstone Project

Throughout this course, you have built a strong foundation in full-stack software development, mastering the essential technologies and concepts that power modern web applications. From structuring web pages with HTML and styling them with CSS to adding interactivity with JavaScript, you've gained the skills to craft dynamic and engaging user experiences. On the backend, you’ve worked with Python, PostgreSQL, and the Django web framework to build robust and scalable applications, leveraging Django REST Framework to create powerful APIs that connect frontend and backend systems.

Beyond the technical skills, you've also explored software development best practices — writing clean and maintainable code, handling user authentication and security, managing databases efficiently, and deploying web applications. Now, as you approach your final project, it’s time to bring all these elements together. This capstone is your opportunity to showcase your full-stack expertise, demonstrating not only your technical proficiency but also your ability to design, develop, and deploy a complete, functional web application from scratch.

Please refer to the `SDA-SIRAJ/projects/02. Capstone-Project.md` file for specific details on the project and expectations.
