# Testing Notes App Models

In this lab, you will apply your knowledge of Django model testing to validate the functionality of models from your Notes App. Just like the lab this morning you will focus on:

- Create / String Representation
- Relationships
- Model Methods / Ordering of Data
- Cascade Deletion

# Setup and Expectation

- Follow the guide from this morning's lecture
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
- Setup the test.py file to reflect your Notes App models / attributes
- Run the file with: `python manage.py test`
- You should have comprehensive testing just like our testing from this morning!
