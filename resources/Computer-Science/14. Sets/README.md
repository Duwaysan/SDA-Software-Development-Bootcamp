# ![Computer Science - Sets](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

Sets are a simple, nifty little data structure. They're similar to arrays with one key difference: They only hold unique values.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- Linked Lists

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Define a set and how it’s used in programming.
- Distinguish between a set, an array, and a linked list.
- Implement a set and common methods used in sets.
