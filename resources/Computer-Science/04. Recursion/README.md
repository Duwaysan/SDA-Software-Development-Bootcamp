# Recursion

## Overview

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Each recursive call works on a smaller instance of the problem, gradually reducing the complexity until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify cases for recursion.
- Write the base case and recursive cases of a recursive function.
- Identify functions that use recursion and explain why it’s used.

## Content

There are two components to this module:

1. Lesson: [Recursion](./lesson/README.md)
2. Exercise: [Writing Recursive Functions](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/cs-recursion-starter-code)

## Solution Code 

- Exercise Solution: [Recursion](./solution/README.md)

### Time to Complete

1.5 hours total:

- 0.5 hour - Recursion Lesson
- 1 hour - Writing Recursive Functions Exercise
