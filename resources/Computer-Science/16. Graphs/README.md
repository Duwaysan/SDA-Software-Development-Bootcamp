# ![Computer Science - Graphs](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

In this lesson, we cover the basics of the node-based data structures known as graphs.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Define a graph and understand the difference between undirected and directed graphs.
- Identify how graphs are used in programming.
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list.
