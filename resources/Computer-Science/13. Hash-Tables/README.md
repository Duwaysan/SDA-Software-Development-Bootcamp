# ![Computer Science - Hash Tables](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

The Hash Tables lesson has two related lessons. The first lesson introduces the concept of hash tables through an analogy, in an easy-to-understand way, while the second lesson gets into more of the technical, nitty-gritty parts of hash tables.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- Linked Lists

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Define hash functions and hash tables.
- Articulate the benefits of hash tables, in particular as they relate to speed of data access.
- Define collisions and how to resolve them.
- Define hash tables, hash functions, and collisions.
- Explain when you would use open addressing or closed addressing to resolve collisions.
- Identify the implementations of hash tables in programming.
