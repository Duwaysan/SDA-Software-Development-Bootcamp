## Overview

This lesson covers two foundational sorting algorithms: bubble sort and insertion sort.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- Introduction to Sorting

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Describe the time and space complexities of bubble sort and insertion sort.
- Implement bubble sort and insertion sort.

## Content

There are two components to this module:

1. Lesson: [Basic Sorting Algorithms](./lesson/README.md)
2. Exercise: [Implementing Bubble & Insertion Sorts](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/basic-sorting-algorithms-starter-code)

## Solution Code
