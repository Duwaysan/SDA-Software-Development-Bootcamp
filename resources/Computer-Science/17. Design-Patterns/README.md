# ![Computer Science - Design Patterns](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

This lesson introduces the high-level concept of design patterns and explains three design pattern types:

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral 

You probably already know this secret about programmers: They love reusing stuff. Frameworks, algorithms, classes — they’re all just things that can be used over and over again to solve similar problems. We also have design patterns: problems that are similar in nature but solved a bit differently every time. Let’s explore them.

### Prerequisites

- None

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Explain why design patterns exist in programming.
- Define creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.
- Identify the implementation of design patterns in programming.

## Content
