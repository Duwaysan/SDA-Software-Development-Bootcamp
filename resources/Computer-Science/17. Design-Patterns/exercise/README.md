## Partner Exercise: Design Patterns Questions

Because it's impossible to code a design pattern on its own, for this exercise, we'll focus on the following discussion questions to explore the concepts of design patterns in more depth.

### Instructions:

1. Find a partner.
2. Spend 20 minutes discussing the following questions.

### Discussion Questions:

1. **What is an abstract class?**
 
    - Provide an example of an abstract class and several subclasses that might inherit from it.
  
3. **Describe a behavioral pattern that influences how React code is written.**
  
4. **What is a Singleton and why might it be helpful?**
  
5. **Throughout the program, our projects have gradually involved more and more files of smaller and smaller sizes.**
 
    - What would you call this concept and why would you implement it?
