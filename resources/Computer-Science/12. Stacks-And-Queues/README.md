# ![Computer Science - Stacks and Queues](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

Mario and Luigi, Romeo and Juliet, Sherlock and Watson... Stacks and Queues are another iconic duo. Stacks and queues are data structures used to store and manage collections of elements, with stacks following a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order and queues following a First In, First Out (FIFO) order.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Distinguish between a stack and a queue.
- Determine situations in which you’d use a stack or queue over another data structure.
- Build a stack and a queue using a linked list or an array.

## Content

There are two components to this module:

1. Lesson: [Stacks and Queues](./lesson/README.md)
2. Exercise: [Bracket Matching](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/stacks-and-queues-starter-code)

## Solution Code 

- Exercise Solution: [Bracket Matching](./solution/README.md)

### Time to Complete

1.5 hours total:

- 0.5 hour - Stacks and Queues Lesson
- 1 hour - Bracket Matching Exercise

## Additional Resources

- Here are visualizations for the two implementations of stacks: the [array implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackArray.html) and [linked list implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackLL.html).
- Same thing for queues: the [array implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/QueueArray.html) and [linked list implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/QueueLL.html).
- Common interview questions about [stacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure) and [queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure).
- Don’t forget to review [priority queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-set-1-introduction) and [deques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications).
