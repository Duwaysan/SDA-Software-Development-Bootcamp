# ![Computer Science - Linked Lists](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

Linked lists are a foundational data structure that many other, more complex structures use as their basis.

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Define a linked list.
- Explain how a node stores data.
- Identify situations where you use a linked list instead of an array.
- Build a singly linked list.
