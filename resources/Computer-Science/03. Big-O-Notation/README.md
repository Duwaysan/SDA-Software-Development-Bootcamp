# ![Computer Science - Big O Notation](./assets/hero.png)

## Overview

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It provides a high-level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm, which helps us predict how it will perform as the input size grows.

### Prerequisites
