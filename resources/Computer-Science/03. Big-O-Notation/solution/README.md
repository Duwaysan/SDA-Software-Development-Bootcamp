## Solutions

### Algorithm #1

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Splitting the phrase and iterating through the words both operate in linear time relative to the length of the phrase.


### Algorithm #2

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)

  - Reasoning: Nested loops each iterating up to the length of the list.


### Algorithm #3

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Recursion occurs n times before reaching the base case.


### Algorithm #4

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(1)

  - Reasoning: Always checks the first element of the array.


### Algorithm #5

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Iterates through the input string twice (once to push onto the stack and once to pop from it).


### Algorithm #6

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Iterates from 1 to n-1.


### Algorithm #7

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Each of the two forEach loops iterates through the array independently.


### Algorithm #8

1. Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Reasoning: Iterates from 2 to num-1.
