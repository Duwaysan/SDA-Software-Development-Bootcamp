# Challenge: 15_merge_intervals
# Prompt:
# You are given a list of intervals represented as pairs [start, end].  
# Write a function called `merge_intervals` that merges all overlapping intervals 
# and returns a new list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by start time.
#
# Example input:
# intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
#
# Example function call:
# merge_intervals(intervals)
#
# Expected output:
# [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
#
# Another example:
# intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# merge_intervals(intervals)
# Expected output:
# [[1,5]]
#
# Constraints:
# - Intervals are represented as lists of two integers [start, end].
# - Intervals may be in any order.
# - Start is always less than or equal to end.
