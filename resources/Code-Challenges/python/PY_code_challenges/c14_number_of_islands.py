# Challenge: 14_number_of_islands
# Prompt:
# You are given a 2D grid (list of lists) representing a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water).  
# An island is a group of connected '1's horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).  
# Write a function called `number_of_islands` that counts the number of islands in the grid.
#
# Example input:
# grid = [
#     ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#     ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#     ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#     ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
#
# Example function call:
# number_of_islands(grid)  # returns 3
#
# Constraints:
# - The grid can be any size (MxN).
# - The grid contains only '1' or '0'.
