# Challenge: 06_letter_count
# Prompt:
# Write a function called 'letter_count' to count the letter
# occurrence in a string. Return a dictionary with a count for each letter.
# 
# HINT:
# Careful. Python requires that you insert a key into a dictionary
# before you try to modify it's value. If you try to access a dictionary
# at a key that hasn't been added you'll get an error and the program will
# crash. Not sure how to do this? Research it to figure it out!
# 
# Example function call:
#
# letter_count('banana')
#
# > {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'n': 2}
