## Details
Coding challenges are a great way to hone your programming skills. Many developers will use an online platform such as [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) to continue challenging themselves after they've learned a language. Doing so allows them to continue to learn and grow, and prevents them from getting rusty in a particular language they may not use every day. 

For the first three units of this cohort we've provided you with 30 beginner-friendly coding challenges to help grow your JavaScript skills, even when we start learning Python in Unit 3. Here's what you can expect:
- The difficulty starts off very easy and ramps up to medium (hard for many students though).
- There are solutions for the last 10 challenges, as they are much more difficult, but try your best to solve the challenge on your own first! These are meant for your personal growth.
- There is always more than one way to accomplish each challenge. If your solution doesn't match any of the provided solutions but still works, don't fret! As a beginner, getting the result is more important than how you get it.
