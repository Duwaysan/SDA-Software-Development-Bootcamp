# Welcome to General Assembly!!!!
For the next 90 days you all will grow tremendously and come out prepared to enter the software engineering industry.  It will be tough, but every single one of you will make it through to the end. The ones who really make an effort will shine and standout to SDA, which could yield even better results. 

## GA's Mission
Every person deserves the opportunity to achieve their aspirations. Through our partnerships and programming, we aim to:
- Ensure anyone with the passion and readiness to succeed can access GA programs.
- Build and foster a tech talent pipeline that reflects the diversity of communities where GA operates and the global GA community.

## Class Conduct

- Please be kind and respectful to **ALL** of your classmates.
- Please **ask questions!**
- Please ask us to slow down if you do not understand or need a translation.
- Please ask each other for help and help someone else if you can tell they need it.

Keep in mind you grow when we challenge you... So we will absolutely help you every step of the way - but we may also challenge you along the way as well, even when we are helping you.. It is only because we want you to be able to find the answer!

## Instructional Team

> Your instructional team is here to support you in all matters. Our goal is to guide you through the process of becoming a software engineer by helping each of you to get from 'Point A to Point B' by providing the conceptual and prodecural steps needed to reach that goal. As such, the course is challenging, and we have resources in place to support you as you work through these challenges. Please reach out and ask questions as needed. Questions are good!

## GA Course Completion:
This course is designed so that everybody will make it to the end. However - the students that collect the highest points and have the highest quality work will stand out to SDA and they can use that information however SDA sees fit. While you may feel like you can be lazy or slack off, it is in your interest, if you want to be successful, to ensure that you work to get every point possible. SDA will see these scores and they absolutely use this information to make decisions on who they may want to invest in further. We highly recommend being on time and making the effort to go for every point possible. These are places where points can be earned:

- Attendance
- Homework Timeliness (1 point per deliverable)
- Homework Completion (1 point per deliverable)
- Code Challenge Timeliness (1 point per challenge)
- Code Challenge Completion (1 point per challenge)
- Soft Skills in class (asking questions, being polite, making an effort, practicing English, presenting work, volunteering, answering questions)
- Hard Skills in class (overall progression, making an effort to do the work, quality of work)
- Project Points - calculated based on completion and accuracy.

### Attendance
You can't learn if you aren't present in the classroom to go through the process. As such, we require you to be in the course 100% of the time. We will track your attendance throughout the course. We take attendance three times per day. Once in the morning, after lunch, and after afternoon prayer. If you are more than 15 minutes late to any attendance check, you will be marked absent for that session. Even if it is only 30 seconds over the 15 minute grace period. This information may be used at any given time for SDA to make decisions regarding a student's standing in the course. 



**- *ALL* ABSENCES THAT WISH TO BE *EXCUSED* MUST GO THROUGH ABDULAZIZ** 

**- We do not have the power to excuse anybody for not being in class.**

**- Class will start within 5 minutes of the time stated on the schedule.**

**- Any missed content will be up to you to catch up on. Showing up to class late is a very poor decision to make and is unprofessional. It will be noted.**

### Deliverables
A Deliverable is an assignment that is required to be submitted and will be graded pass/fail. Although not all labs/homework are required to be submitted as deliverables, they are still to be completed when assigned since they provide the necessary practice for the lessons taught.

- Deliverables must "work" to gain the "Completion" point.
- Deliverables must be turned in by the next day for "Timeliness" point.
- Incomplete Deliverables must be corrected by Monday morning the week after the week in which the homework was assigned.. So you will have the weekend to make corrections and get the point. We like progress!
- Thursday homework can have until Tuesday morning if there is a major issue. Otherwise it should likely be corrected immediately and notify us that the correction(s) has been made. We will adjust accordingly.

### Projects
There will be two projects throughout the duration of the course. Each project has a clear guide as to how points can be collected for that project. We will go over each of the projects to make sure these point systems are clear so that you equally have the chance to get every point possible.

### Superlatives
At the end of the cohort, you will vote on which of your fellow classmates best exemplifies the following traits:

<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Researcher </td>
		<td>• shared the best online resources</td>
