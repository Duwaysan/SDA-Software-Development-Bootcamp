# 🌟 Software Development Bootcamp — Personal Reference Repository

<img width="100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/CYx9Es5.png" />

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is a **personal reference archive** from my participation in the **Saudi Digital Academy (SDA)** Software Development Bootcamp, delivered in collaboration with **General Assembly**.

Although my current specialization is in **AI Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Full-Stack development**, this bootcamp formed a strong foundation that I continue to use when building backends, APIs, dashboards, and internal tools.  
This repo remains as a **clean, structured source of reference** to revisit concepts and patterns whenever needed.
